            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                Hello there! I graduated from the Department of Chemical
                Engineering at Gazi University in 2021 and worked in chemical analysis and R&D for a while. However, I always had a
                passion for coding and designing!
                
                Since I was young, painting has been a hobby of mine. I enjoy working with different techniques such as oil, acrylic,
                and charcoal. This hobby has helped me develop my creativity and aesthetic sense. Now, I try to further improve myself
                in every project by combining my creativity with web design and software development.
                
                As a professional, it is important for me to constantly renew and develop myself. Learning new technologies and working
                on projects excites me. Additionally, traveling, discovering new places, and being close to nature are important
                passions of mine.
                
                I am an ambitious, creative, and curious person. When I participate in any project, I am happy to put all my skills and
                energy into it. I also enjoy collaborating and understanding the importance of teamwork.
                
                The most important thing for me is to love my work and fulfill my dreams. That's why I always keep myself open to
                improvement and renewal. Everything I have done so far has brought me here, and everything I will do in the future will
                take me further.
